# Detected student focused states (Computer Vision Project)
* Dlib library
* YOLOv5

  ## ABOUT THE PROJECT
  The main objective of this project was to detect student attention in virtual classroom.

#### We build up 2 models :
* One for detecting the students attention if they
focused or not by detecting the student face
via Dlib library

* The other model was detecting student
attention based on student emotions using
YOLOv5
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### The first model using Dlib was about detecting the points of the face and eye to decide wither the student focused or not . 
##### The model will run a sound alert if the students look away( up, down, left,right).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
##### The second model using YOLO was about detecting the student's attention via their emotions.
##### The model will detect 6 emotions(Bored - Focused - Frustrated - Looking away - Sleepy - confused)
